			"description": "Folders are identified by the identifier (id) and the unique identifier (uid).\nThe identifier (id) of a folder is an auto-incrementing numeric value and is only unique per Grafana install.\nThe unique identifier (uid) of a folder can be used for uniquely identify folders between multiple Grafana installs. Itâ€™s automatically generated if not provided when creating a folder. The uid allows having consistent URLs for accessing folders and when syncing folders between multiple Grafana installs. This means that changing the title of a folder will not break any bookmarked links to that folder.\nThe uid can have a maximum length of 40 characters.\n\nThe General folder (id=0) is special and is not part of the Folder API which means that you cannot use this API for retrieving information about the General folder."

			"description": "The Admin HTTP API does not currently work with an API Token. API Tokens are currently only linked to an organization and an organization role. They cannot be given the permission of server admin, only users can be given that permission. So in order to use these API calls you will have to use Basic Auth and the Grafana user must have the Grafana Admin permission. (The default admin user is called admin and has permission to use this API.)"
