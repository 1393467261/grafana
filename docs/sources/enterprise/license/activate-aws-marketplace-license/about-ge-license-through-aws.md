# About Grafana Enterprise licenses from AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is a convenient place to buy and manage a Grafana Enterprise license, especially if you are already an AWS customer.

You can deploy Grafana Enterprise in the following ways:

- You can deploy Grafana Enterprise in AWS ECS or AWS EKS, or,
- You can deploy Grafana Enterprise on a Grafana Enterprise instance outside AWS.

In both cases, you must activate the Grafana Enterprise license purchased in AWS Marketplace to take advantage of Grafana Enterprise observability features.

The following topics guide you in activating a Grafana Enterprise license for both deployment use cases.

> To purchase a license directly from Grafana Labs or learn more about other Grafana offerings, [Contact a Grafana Labs representative](https://grafana.com/contact?about=grafana-enterprise).

## Before you begin:

Become an AWS customer. Only AWS customers have access to AWS Marketplace. To learn more about becoming an AWS customer, refer to [Sign up for AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).
