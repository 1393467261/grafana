# Create a Grafana library panel

Before you begin can use library panels, you have to create them.

> **Note:** When you create library panels, the panel on the source dashboard is converted to a library panel as well. You will need to save the original dashboard once a panel is converted.

To create a library panel, complete the following steps:

1. [Add a panel]({{< relref "./add-a-panel.md" >}}) or use an existing panel.
1. Click the title of the panel and then click **Edit**.
   The panel opens in edit mode.

1. In the panel display options (side pane), click the down arrow option to bring changes to the visualization.

1. In **Library panel name**, enter the name.
1. In **Save in folder**, select the folder to save the library panel.
1. Click **Create library panel** to save your changes.
1. Save the dashboard.

Once created, you can modify the library panel using any dashboard on which it appears. After you save the changes, all instances of the library panel reflect these modifications.
