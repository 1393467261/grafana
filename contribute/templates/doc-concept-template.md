# Concept

The title of the _concept_ content type is generally a noun (a person, place, or thing) or a gerund (a word that ends with an _-ing_).

A concept is for any information that is not a procedure or a reference:

* concept
* idea
* overview
* workflow

In the introduction, explain to the reader what to expect in this unit of information. An example of a concept is the [Permissions overview](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/permissions/overview/).

## Idea

Concept topics or sections explain _what_ and _why_. They do not explain _how_. If you are a new user, you might look for concept information to learn about what Grafana is, why it might be useful to you, and what the general workflow is.

## Workflow

Continuing the example in the previous section, here is a sample Grafana workflow.

1. Install Grafana. <link to task for installing Grafana>
1. Set up data sources. <link to data sources concept topic, which links to data source task topics>
1. Create panels. <link to panel concept topic, which links to tasks>
1. Create dashboards. <link to panel concept topic, which links to tasks>
1. Enter queries. <link to query editor concept topic>
1. Add users. <link to user management concept topic, which links to tasks>
1. Create playlists. <link to Playlist topic that contains concept information and tasks>

## Next steps

Concepts often link to related information, such as a _procedure_ or a _reference_.
